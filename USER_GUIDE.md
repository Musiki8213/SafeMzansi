## Understanding the Map Colors

The map uses colors to show how dangerous an area is:

| Color | Meaning | What it means |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 🟤 **Brown** | Low Risk | 1-2 reports within 300 meters |
| 🟠 **Orange** | Medium Risk | 3-5 reports within 300 meters |
| 🔴 **Red** | High Risk | 6+ reports within 300 meters |

**How it works:**
- The app counts how many reports are near each location
- More reports = higher risk = darker color
- Use this to avoid dangerous areas!
