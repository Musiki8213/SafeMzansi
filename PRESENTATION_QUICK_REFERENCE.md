- MongoDB/Mongoose

**New Knowledge Applied:**
- Capacitor for mobile
- Vercel serverless
- MapLibre for maps

---

### 4. CREATIVITY (80-90%)
**"I converted the vague problem of 'community safety awareness' into a concrete software solution with interactive maps, real-time reporting, and multi-platform deployment."**

**Creative Solutions:**
- Heatmap visualization for danger zones
- Multi-platform strategy (Web + Mobile)
- Real-time updates with polling
- PWA for offline access

---

### 5. MODELLING (75-85%)
**"I created data models (User, Report schemas), API route structures, component architecture, and deployment diagrams to organize the application."**

**Models Created:**
- Mongoose schemas (User, Report)
- API route structure
- React component hierarchy
- Deployment architecture

---

### 6. DEBUGGING (90-95%)
**"I diagnosed and fixed 5+ complex issues including Java version conflicts, MongoDB connection errors, Android SDK configuration, and Vercel deployment problems using systematic debugging."**

**Debugging Process:**
1. Read error messages carefully
2. Identify root cause
3. Research solution
4. Implement fix
5. Document for future

---

### 7. SDLC AWARENESS (80-90%)
**"I followed an Agile/iterative approach with sprints for authentication, reporting, maps, mobile conversion, and deployment. Covered all SDLC phases from planning to maintenance."**

**Phases:**
- Planning: Requirements, tech stack
- Development: 5 sprints
- Testing: Manual testing
- Deployment: Vercel + Mobile
- Maintenance: Documentation

---

### 8. PROGRAMMING DIFFICULTY (85-95%)
**"I wrote code at multiple levels: simple API endpoints, intermediate authentication, advanced algorithms (hotspot detection), and expert-level cross-platform mobile integration."**

**Levels:**
- Beginner: Basic components
- Intermediate: Auth, CRUD
- Advanced: Algorithms, serverless
- Expert: Cross-platform, optimization

---

### 9. TECHNOLOGIES (90-95%)
**"I understand the purpose of each technology: React for UI, Express for APIs, MongoDB for data, Capacitor for mobile, Vercel for deployment. Made informed choices based on project needs."**

**Technologies:**
- Frontend: React, Vite, MapLibre, Capacitor
- Backend: Express, MongoDB, JWT
- DevOps: Vercel, MongoDB Atlas, Gradle

---

### 10. GROUP WORK (70-80%)
**"As an individual project, I demonstrated collaboration through comprehensive documentation, maintainable code structure, and knowledge-sharing guides that enable future team collaboration."**

**Collaboration Skills:**
- Documentation for others
- Code organization
- Knowledge transfer
- Problem-solving guides

## ❓ ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: Why Capacitor instead of React Native?**
A: "Capacitor allows code reuse from our React web app, reducing development time. We can maintain one codebase for web and mobile."

**Q: Why Vercel for deployment?**
A: "Vercel provides excellent serverless functions, automatic scaling, CDN, and easy deployment. Perfect for our Express backend."

**Q: How does the hotspot detection work?**
A: "I implemented a clustering algorithm that groups nearby reports, calculates density, and assigns color codes based on severity levels."

**Q: What was the biggest challenge?**
A: "Converting the Express app to work with Vercel's serverless architecture required restructuring the code to export properly as serverless functions."

**Q: How did you handle authentication?**
A: "JWT tokens for stateless authentication, works well with serverless architecture. Tokens stored in localStorage on client side."
